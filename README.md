   The popular Iris dataset has been analysed and the "K Nearest Neighbours (KNN) Algorithm" is used. This is a non-parametric, supervised learning classifier, which uses proximity (hence "neighbours") to make classifications or predictions about the grouping of an individual data point.
   My code uses Euclidean distance since no other parameter is specified.

   I have used seaborn and matplotlib to analyse and create explanatory graphs. I have also used the "calendar" and "datetime" libraries to work with dates. The data has been formatted for further use.
