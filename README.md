1. Iris_Classif.ipynb:
   The popular Iris dataset has been analysed and the "K Nearest Neighbours (KNN) Algorithm" is used. This is a non-parametric, supervised learning classifier, which     uses proximity (hence "neighbours") to make classifications or predictions about the grouping of an individual data point.
   My code uses Euclidean distance since no other parameter is specified.
